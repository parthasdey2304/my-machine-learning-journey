# my-machine-learning-journey
Here I document my journey of Machine Learning!

# Roadmap
To grasp the concepts of machine learning I would choose the path of : 
+ Python Basics
+ `numpy`
+ `pandas`
+ `matplotlib`
+ `sklearn`
+ `scrapy`
+ `bs4`
+ `selenium`

## Python Basics
These is a small python documentation for learning python from scratch!

### Printing
+ This is how you print `Hello world!` in Python : 
#### Code
``` py
print("Hello world!")
```
#### Output
```
Hello world!
```
+ This is how you add something at the end of a string in Python :
#### Code
``` py
print("Hello World", end = "!!")
```
#### Output
```
Hello World!!
```

### Variables
+ This is how you declare variables in Python :
#### Code
``` py
a = 5
b = 10
```

+ This is how you write multiple variables in a single line using semi-colon(;) :
``` py
a = 5; b = 10
```

### Comments
Comments are lines of statements that are ignored by the python interpreter while execution of the program.
There are two ways of writting comments : 
+ `Single line comments` : Using hastags' # ' in the beginning of the line makes a single line comment.
``` py
# This is a single line comment
a = 5 # assigning 5 to the variable a
```

+ `Multi-line comments` : Using triple single quotes or triple double quotes before the starting and at the ending of the statement.
``` py
''' This is a multi-line comment
You can even use Triple double quotes """
for making multi-line comments
```

### Data Types
+ `Integer(int)` : Represents whole numbers without any fractional part, such as 5, -10, 1000, etc.
+ `Float(float)` : Represents real numbers with both integer and fractional parts, such as 3.14, -0.001, 2.0, etc.
+ `String(str)` : Represents sequences of characters enclosed within single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or triple quotes (''''' or """).
+ `Boolean(bool)` : Represents the truth values `True` and `False`, which are used for logical operations.
+ `List` : Represents an ordered collection of items. Lists are mutable, which means you can change their elements after creation.
+ `Tuple` : Similar to lists, but tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change the elements after creation.
+ `Dictionary(dict)` :  Represents a collection of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces {}. Keys within a dictionary must be unique.
+ `Set` : Represents an unordered collection of unique items. Sets do not allow duplicate elements.
+ `NoneType(None)` : Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

These are the primary built-in data types in Python. Additionally, Python allows for defining custom data types using classes and objects.

### Operators
There are a few types of operators in Python :
#### Assignment Operator : 
Assignment operator is used to assign values to a variable.
``` py
a = 5
```

#### Arithmatic Operator : 
These are the operators that perform mathematical calculations in python : 
+ `sum` : This is used to add two numbers `+`.
``` py
sum = 5 + 4
```
+ `difference` : This is used to subtract two numbers `-`.
``` py
difference = 10 - 4
```
+ `product` : This is used to multiply two numbers `*`.
``` py
product = 3 * 4
```
+ `quotient` :  This is used to divide two numbers and get the quotient `/`.
``` py
quotient = 10 / 2
```
+ `remainder` : This is used to divide two numbers and get the remainder `%`.
``` py
remainder = 17 % 3
```
+ `exponent` :  This is used to get a number raised to the power of its exponenet `**`.
``` py
raised_to_power = 2 ** 5
```

#### Relational Operator
This is used to compare two data values :
