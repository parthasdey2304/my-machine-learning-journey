# my-machine-learning-journey
Here I document my journey of Machine Learning!

# Roadmap
To grasp the concepts of machine learning I would choose the path of : 
+ Python Basics
+ `numpy`
+ `pandas`
+ `matplotlib`
+ `sklearn`
+ `scrapy`
+ `bs4`
+ `selenium`

## Python Basics
These is a small python documentation for learning python from scratch!

### Printing
+ This is how you print `Hello world!` in Python : 
#### Code
``` py
print("Hello world!")
```
#### Output
```
Hello world!
```
+ This is how you add something at the end of a string in Python :
#### Code
``` py
print("Hello World", end = "!!")
```
#### Output
```
Hello World!!
```

### Variables
+ This is how you declare variables in Python :
#### Code
``` py
a = 5
b = 10
```

+ This is how you write multiple variables in a single line using semi-colon(;) :
``` py
a = 5; b = 10
```

### Data Types
+ `Integer(int)` : Represents whole numbers without any fractional part, such as 5, -10, 1000, etc.
+ `Float(float)` : Represents real numbers with both integer and fractional parts, such as 3.14, -0.001, 2.0, etc.
+ `String(str)` : Represents sequences of characters enclosed within single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or triple quotes (''''' or """).
+ `Boolean(bool)` : Represents the truth values `True` and `False`, which are used for logical operations.
+ `List` : Represents an ordered collection of items. Lists are mutable, which means you can change their elements after creation.
+ `Tuple` : Similar to lists, but tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change the elements after creation.
+ `Dictionary(dict)` :  Represents a collection of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces {}. Keys within a dictionary must be unique.
+ `Set` : Represents an unordered collection of unique items. Sets do not allow duplicate elements.
+ `NoneType(None)` : Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

These are the primary built-in data types in Python. Additionally, Python allows for defining custom data types using classes and objects.
